    <h3>The Project in a Nutshell</h3>
    <p>TEMA is a four-year-long project funded by the European Union flagship research and innovation programme Horizon Europe, under the call HORIZON-CL4-2022-DATA-01-01 “Methods for exploiting data and knowledge for extremely precise outcomes (analysis, prediction, decision support), reducing complexity and presenting insights in understandable ways”.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The goal of TEMA is to deliver a technical solution that is supportive in disaster response and management by bringing situational data to relevant end-users, enabling transferability to tackle different disaster types in various geographic regions thus providing the relevant information that can help make the best possible operative decisions.</p>
